  <center><b><p>Personality</p></b></center>
<p>Squidward is usually portrayed to be a whiny, stick-in-the-mud character. He is very egotistical and cannot stand saying sorry to anyone or admitting his mistakes. He considers himself very sophisticated and upper class, and looks down on most other people. Squidward makes jokes to himself that aren't even funny. Squidward is impatient for most of the time, egotistical and finds everything dull and trivial. </p>
<b><p>Lifestyle</p></b> Squidward works as the cashier in the Krusty Krab, but he hates his job, largely because he has to work with SpongeBob. Squidward also loves art and has many self-portraits of himself all around his house, but rarely paints anything else. He seems to think that he is a talented clarinet player, but really, his songs are usually very out of tune. Squidward also enjoys watching television, listening to the radio, riding his bike and reading. He takes great pleasure from treating and pampering himself, although while he is relaxing, usually SpongeBob interrupts him.
