<center><p>Patrick Star is SpongeBob SquarePant's best friend and sidekick. He lives next door to SpongeBob at 120 Conch Street, under a rock.</p>

<p>Patrick is an oaf who is dull, dim-witted and dumb, although he occasionally surprises everyone with flashes of brilliance. He has a bad memory (he went to community college but doesn't remember what he studied there) and little common sense, but he picks up on animosity better than SpongeBob.</p>

<p>He has had many jobs, including a worker at Krusty Krab with SpongeBob, but he owes the owner Mr. Krabs, a lot of money from eating too many Krabby Patties. He has also tried to be an inventor but only came up with things (pencils, light bulb) that had already been invented.</p>

<p>Background: He is a chubby starfish who does not have a nose and loves ice cream. He wears green board shorts. Has a big sister named Sam Star. His parents are Herb and Margie Star. Gary the Snail is his cousin and Sluggo is his uncle. He wears underwear to sleep. He is freakishly strong and can lift the rock he lives under. He is also an excellent driver. His arms regenerate and when he thinks, his brain emits stinky steam.</p>
