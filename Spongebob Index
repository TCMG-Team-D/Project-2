<h2> Howdy!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am freshman technology management major at <a href="http://tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a>.
I am involved in a freshmen leadership organization called FLiP, a women's organization called Ryllies, a national defense
leadership organization called Silver Wings, and am a Fish Camp counselor for session B camp Barttlebort.
<a href="http://rylliesselections.wix.com/rylliestamu">Ryllies</a> 
is a women's organization that focuses on serving the community while upholding the pillars Texas A&amp;M was founded upon. Ryllies stands for
respecting youself while demonstrating leadership, loyalty, integrity, excellence, and selfless service.
</p>
<p> As you may have noticed, I am a loud and proud member of the Fighting Texas Aggie Class of 2018. 
AAAAAAAAAA! This is where you can learn more about my passions in life. If you have any questions feel free to
shoot me an email located at the bottom of the website.</p>
<p>Thanks and Gig'Em!</p>
