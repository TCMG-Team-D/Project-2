<p> Spongebob is a childhood legend. From the quirky laugh to the uplifting attitude, he is always a thrill to watch. The yellow sponge is best known for his square pants and famous pineapple house at 124 Conch Street in Bikini Bottom. He lives in his pineapple with his pet snail Gary, happy as a clam eating his snailpo. Spongebob’s biggest achievement is when he finally gets his boating license on June 14, 1986 and is able to leave Mrs. Puff’s boating school.In addition to his squarepants, SpongeBob also wears ankle socks, shiny black leather shoes and a short-sleeved white shirt and red tie -- all of which are referred to as his pants. He has blue eyes with three eyelashes on each one, and bright blue eyes and two big buck teeth. He is 4 inches tall.  Although he is a sea sponge, he is shaped like a kitchen sponge. The happy fellow works as a cook at the ocean famous Krusty Krab making top secrete Krabby Patties.</p>

<p> Patrick Star is Spongebob’s best friend for life!!! They share a similar personality and love to go jellyfish hunting through the open waters. Both are not favored by the other citizens of Bikini Bottom, but they are so optimistic they do not even notice others annoyance with them. </p>
